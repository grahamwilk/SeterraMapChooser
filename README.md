# SeterraMapChooser
chooses seterra maps and categories using an algorithm I created

Personal project that I used in order to generate a map pool for a geography tournament I hosted.

What I learned while making this:
* Improved my logic skills.
* Improved my skills with reading data from CSV files.
* Learned to clean up and create my own CSV files to be used with the program.
